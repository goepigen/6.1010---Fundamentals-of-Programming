# 6.1010 - fundamentals of programming
This repository contains the completed assignments of 6.1010 of Spring 2025. 

The [course website](https://py.mit.edu/spring25) can be accessed but I am pretty sure it will be taken down when there is a new session of the course in the future.

The materials seem to stay pretty much the same (it is possible to find previous versions of the course online).

### w0 - audio processing

### w1 - image processing 1

### w2 - image processing 2
Run `python ui.py` to see a quick and dirty UI I made (using PyQt6) that displays an original color image, the image converted to greyscale, the results of blur and sharpen filters (each with a slider for choosing the respective kernel_size used in the filter), and four images related to the seam-carving task (energy, cumulative energy map, original image with seam highlighted, and image without n seams (n chosen with a slider)).

### w3 - bacon number

### w4 - snekoban

### w6 - recipes

### w8 - mice sleeper
